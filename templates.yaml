help: You can use Job Search to search for jobs. You can start by saying something like 'Find me a software engineer job in San Francisco'. Specifying the city is optional, but recommended. Job Search will find jobs for you based on your query. Say 'Yes' to read out the first one. After that, you can either ask for the requirements for the job, or experience for the job, or hear the next job, or stop. What would you like to do?
